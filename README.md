# Q-Learning Maze Explorer

## Overview

**Q-Learning Maze Explorer** is a simple educational project that demonstrates how an agent can learn to navigate a maze using the Q-Learning algorithm. The environment includes a start point, obstacles, treasures, and an exit, and the agent learns to find the optimal path while maximizing rewards.

> ðŸ“˜ This project was created as part of a class assignment to explore the fundamentals of reinforcement learning.

## Features

- **Maze Environment**  
  A grid-based maze with start, exit, walls, and collectible treasures.

- **Q-Learning Algorithm**  
  Implementation of the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to enable the agent to learn an efficient navigation strategy.

- **Path Visualization**  
  Visual output of the agentâ€™s learned optimal path after training.

## System Requirements

- **Programming Language**: Python 

## Technologies Used

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning  
- **Language**: Python
